# Servo-Motors-and-Digital-Potentiometer-Prototype

Notes: 

  -This code aims to test both the two servo motors being used and the two digital potentiometers being used
  
  -It does this by using user input from the serial terminal to control the value of a digital potentiometer which adjusts a servo motors position
  
  -In the final product a remote control will be used instead of the serial terminal
  
  -Also note that in the final product the servo motors will change position based on changes in volume and freqeuncy
  
  -Digital potentiometer code adapated from: https://electropeak.com/learn/interfacing-x9c103s-10k-digital-potentiometer-module-with-arduino/
