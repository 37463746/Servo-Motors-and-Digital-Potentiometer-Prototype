# Servo-Motors-and-Digital-Potentiometer-Prototype

Important: The diagram of the prototype can be found under the tab labelled "Wiki" within this repository

Notes: 
  This code aims to test both the two servo motors being used and the two digital potentiometers being used
  It does this by using user input from the serial terminal to control the value of a digital potentiometer which adjusts a servo motors position
  In the final product a remote control will be used instead of the serial terminal
  Also note that in the final product the servo motors will change position based on changes in volume and freqeuncy
